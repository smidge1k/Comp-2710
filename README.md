-Develop object-oriented software designs that map to requirements identified in analysis
-Grasp both C++ Syntax and Semantics
-Develop software using sound programming principles
-Use assertions and design by contract to develop high-reliability programs
-Understand concepts of data abstraction, efficiency, and memory management
-Understand how to perform unit and system-level testing
-Apply a variety of strategies to debug simple programs
-Use software tools (e.g., gdb, make, argoUML and MS Visio) in support of the software development
-Describe how to use version control to conduct software release management
-Demonstrate capability to use runtime configuration to bind variable values and program settings when a program is running
